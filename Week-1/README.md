# Week-1
My project is on the E-Waste Generation Classification.

Week-1
The Improvements i have done so far are :
- Improved error handling for file uploads and class folder checks.
- Added data augmentation (flip, rotation, zoom, contrast) for better generalization.
- Partial fine-tuning of later layers only
- Adaptive epoch count based on dataset size.

The further Improvents to be made are :
- Adding precision, recall to the model for better enhancement
- Adding test dataset evaluation.
- Add option to upload multiple images at once for Gradio Interfave.
- User can be able to download the predictions as a report (CSV).
